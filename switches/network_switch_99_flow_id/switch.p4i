/* P4-16 declaration of the P4 v1.0 switch model */

/* Note 1: More details about the definition of v1model architecture
 * can be found at the location below.
 *
 * https://github.com/p4lang/behavioral-model/blob/main/docs/simple_switch.md
 *
 * Note 3: There are at least some P4_14 implementations where
 * invoking a generate_digest operation on a field_list will create a
 * message to the control plane that contains the values of those
 * fields when the ingress control is finished executing, which can be
 * different than the values those fields have at the time the
 * generate_digest operation is invoked in the program, if those field
 * values are changed later in the execution of the P4_14 ingress
 * control.
 *
 * The P4_16 plus v1model implementation should always create digest
 * messages that contain the values of the specified fields at the
 * time that the digest extern function is called.  Thus if a P4_14
 * program expecting the behavior described above is compiled using
 * p4c, it may behave differently.

 *
 * The session parameter is an integer identifying a clone session id

 * be made using that session.  Typically this will involve the

/***

 * compiling, the compiled program behaves as if all assert statements
 * were not present in the source code.
 *
 * We strongly recommend that you avoid using expressions as an
 * argument to an assert call that can have side effects, e.g. an
 * extern method or function call that has side effects.  p4c will
 * allow you to do this with no warning given.  We recommend this
 * because, if you follow this advice, your program will behave the

/***
 * For the purposes of compiling and executing P4 programs on a target

 *
 * The reason that assume exists as a separate function from assert is
 * because they are expected to be used differently by formal
 * verification tools.  For some formal tools, the goal is to try to
 * find example packets and sets of installed table entries that cause
 * an assert statement condition to be false.
 *
 * Suppose you run such a tool on your program, and the example packet
 * given is an MPLS packet, i.e. hdr.ethernet.etherType == 0x8847.
 * You look at the example, and indeed it does cause an assert
 * condition to be false.  However, your plan is to deploy your P4
 * program in a network in places where no MPLS packets can occur.
 * You could add extra conditions to your P4 program to handle the
 * processing of such a packet cleanly, without assertions failing,
 * but you would prefer to tell the tool "such example packets are not
 * applicable in my scenario -- never show them to me".  By adding a
 * statement:
 *
 *     assume(hdr.ethernet.etherType != 0x8847);
 *
 * at an appropriate place in your program, the formal tool should
 * never show you such examples -- only ones that make all such assume
 * conditions true.
 *
 * The reason that assume statements behave the same as assert
 * statements when compiled to a target device is that if the
 * condition ever evaluates to false when operating in a network, it
 * is likely that your assumption was wrong, and should be reexamined.
